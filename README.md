## Improvements for PlanMyTrip Application
### Overview:
After the successful launch of PlanMyTrip app, we got some improvement suggestions from the Beta testers.  These suggestions include:  
* Adding the weather description for the data retrieved
* Use input statements from users to filter the data for their weather preferences, which will be used to identify potential travel destinations and nearby hotels
* From the list of potential travel destinations, the beta tester will choose four cities to create a travel itinerary
* Finally, using the Google Maps Directions API, you will create a travel route between the four cities as well as a marker layer map

### Results:
 
We used about 2000 random latitudes and longitudes combinations to get around 731 cities around the world as shown in the image from the code below:

Later, we saved the results as a csv file.

We used input statements to retrieve customer weather preferences, then we used those preferences to identify potential travel destinations and nearby hotels.
Then, we showed those destinations on a marker layer map with pop-up markers:

Then, we used the Google Directions API to create a travel itinerary that shows the route between four cities chosen from the customerâ€™s possible travel destinations.
We created a marker layer map with a pop-up marker for each city on the itinerary:

### Summary:

We are confident that PlanMyTrip app will add value for the company to attract more travelers to plan their travel need through using our application.
